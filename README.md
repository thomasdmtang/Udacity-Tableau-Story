# Udacity-Tableau-Story

Design:
I primarily wanted to explore which team stats were good predictors of successful teams at the 2018 World Cup. I am not a soccer fan so I started with using the data to determine which teams advanced to the Semi-Finals and called this the “Final 4 Teams”. I then used bar charts to explore each team stat from the dataset to see which stats these Final 4 Teams excelled in. Obviously, goals per game would be the easiest indicator, but I wanted to explore “what else”.
